## Team Meeting 1 Agenda
- Introductions
- Course logistics
- Datasets

### Attendance: Narjis, Matthew, Jacklyn, Mikaela, Ella, Evelyn, Ritu

## Team Meeting 1 Notes
- Add Evelyn and Ritu to the repo
- Broadly interested in health topics, mental health, virology, immunology etc over environmental microbiomes
- Depression dataset: we are the first ones analyzing it, could be tricky if there are any hiccups
  - Will probably need to do some extra psych research
  - Current depression dataset has HIV/HCV coinfection but patient group not specified in the metadata so we shouldn't use it 
- Have a research question decided by the end of next meeting (**Tues Feb 3**)
- Can find the paper associated with the dataset and send it to Evelyn by the end of **Friday Jan 30**, she'll look at the data and metadata
- Have a backup of another dataset to use in case we can't find one

### Post-Meeting Action Items
1. Send papers with datasets to Evelyn: by EOD **Friday Jan 30**
2. Set research question: by end of team meeting **Tuesday Feb 3**
